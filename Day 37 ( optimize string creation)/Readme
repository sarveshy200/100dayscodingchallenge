This code is measuring the performance of two different ways of concatenating strings, using a for loop. The first method uses the + operator to concatenate the strings, while the second method uses the StringBuilder class. The code calculates the time taken for each method and prints the results.

====>Sample Input
String str1 = "India";
String str2 = "India";

====>Sample Output

Time taken by String: 1ms
Time taken by new String: 4ms
