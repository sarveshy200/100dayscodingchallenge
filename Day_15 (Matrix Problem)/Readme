The code is a function that sums the values of each row and column.
The code starts by printing "The sum of each row" to the console, then loops through all the rows in a matrix.
It prints out "The sum of each element" for every iteration, then adds up all the elements in that row.
After it has done this for all rows, it does the same thing with columns.
In order to do this, we need an array called a which is initialized with three different arrays: {1, 5, 5}, {7, 9, 8}, and {3, 7, 5}.
In order to loop through these arrays we use i as our index variable (which stands for "index").
We can also see how many elements there are in each array using j as our index variable (which stands for "joint").
For example: for (int[] i : a) { sum = 0; for (int j : i) { We start at 1 and go down until we hit 3 on line 2.
Then on line 3 we print out what value was found at that position on line 2 - here it would be 1 because there were only
The code creates a matrix with three rows and three columns.

This code calculates the sum of each row, column, and element in a 3x3 matrix. It also finds the column and row with the greatest sum.



==> sample input
 {1, 5, 5},
 {7, 9, 8},
 {3, 7, 5}

==> sample output

The sum of each row
11
24
15
The sum of each Column
11
21
18
The sum of each element
50
Column 2 have greatest sum: 21
Row 2 have greatest sum: 24
