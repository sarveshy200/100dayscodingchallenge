This program is written in Java and uses the Scanner class to take input from the user. The program prompts the user to enter a number, and then it uses a while loop to add up the numbers from 1 to the number entered by the user. The variable "sum" is used to keep track of the sum of the numbers, and the variable "i" is used as a counter in the while loop. After the while loop, the program prints out the sum of the numbers.
