Find Pairs with given sum in sorted Array

Given an array A of size N
we need to find all pairs in the array that sum to a number equal to K
if no such pair exists  the output will be -1

Array element are distinct and in a sorted order

for example-

arr[]={1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
sum=9

output:

pair (2,7)
pair (3,6)
pair (4,5)
