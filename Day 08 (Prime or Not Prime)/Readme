This program is written in Java and is used to check if a number entered by the user is a prime number. It uses the Scanner class to take input from the user, which is an integer representing a number. The program first checks if the number is 2, if it is then it prints out "Prime Number" without checking further. If the number is not 2 then it uses a for loop to check if the number is divisible by any number between 2 and n-1 (inclusive). If the number is divisible by any of these numbers then it is not prime. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number. After the for loop, the program checks the boolean variable isPrime, if it's true, it prints out "Prime Number" otherwise it prints out "Not Prime Number"
