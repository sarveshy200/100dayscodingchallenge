An anagram of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are an anagram of each other.

Examples:

Input: str1 = “listen”  str2 = “silent”
Output: “Anagram”
Explanation: All characters of “listen” and “silent” are the same.

 The code is a method that takes two strings and determines if they are anagrams.
 The code starts by creating an array of 256 integers called count.
 This is the number of characters in each string.
 Next, it loops through both strings and counts the number of times each character appears in one string or the other.
 If any character's count is not zero then they are not anagrams so it prints "Not Anagram".
 The code prints out "Anagram" if any of the characters in string1 or string2 are not zero.
 
 ====>Sample input
  isAnagram("listen","silent");
  
  ====>Sample Output
