The program is designed to find common elements in three different arrays.
The function commonly takes in the three arrays as parameters and uses three variables, x, y, and z, as counters for each array. 
The program then enters a while loop that runs until x, y, and z are all less than the lengths of their respected arrays. 
If the elements in the arrays pointed to by x, y, and z are all equal, then that element is printed and the counters are incremented. If the element in array 1 is greater than the element in array 2, then the counter for array 2 is incremented. The same goes for if the element in array 2 is greater than the element in array 3. 
If the element in array 1 is less than the element in array 2, then the counter for array 1 is incremented.

===>Sample Input 
 int arr1[]={1,5,10,20,40,80};
 int arr2[]={6,7,20,80,100};
 int arr3[]={3,4,15,20,30,70,80,100};
 
 ====>Sample Output
 
 Common Element in Three sorted array is:
20
80
