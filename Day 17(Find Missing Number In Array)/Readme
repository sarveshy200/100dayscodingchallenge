The code is finding the missing element in an array. 
The array should not have duplicates, and the values should be in range. 
It does this by finding the sum of the elements in the array and the sum of the range of elements that should be in the array. 
The missing element is the difference between these two sums.


===>Sample Input 
{1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10}

===>Sample output

Sum of Elements in array:49
Sum of range of elements in array:55
Missing Number is: 6
