 The code starts by declaring the variables mat1 and mat2.
 The first matrix is a 2x3 array of integers, while the second matrix is a 2x3 array of integers.
 The loop iterates through each row of mat1 and adds up all the values in that row to create a new value for result[i][j].
 It prints out this new value on System.out followed by " " (a space).
 Then it loops through each column of mat1[i] and does the same thing, adding up all values from that column to create a new value for result[i][j].
 It prints out this new value on System.out followed by " ".
 The code iterates through the rows of mat1, and then iterates through the columns of mat2.
 It then adds up all the elements in the same position in each row or column.
