 The code is a program that prints out the numbers 1 through 10 in order.
 The outer loop iterates over each row, and the inner-columns iterates over each column.
 The code checks to see if it is on a boundary cell (i == 1 or i == totRows or j == 1 or j == totCols).
 If so, then it prints an asterisk (*) at the beginning of the line.
 Otherwise, it prints a space followed by another space.
 The code will produce a  hollow reactangle of length 4 by 5.
