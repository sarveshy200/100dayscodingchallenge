For example:

Input   :{5, 1, 2, 6, 4, 4, 5}
Output :{5, 1, 2, 6, 4}

In this example, 4 and 5 appear multiple times in an input array.

In the output, All the duplicates are removed and we have printed only distinct elements of an array.

===>Sample Input
int arr[] = { 5, 1, 2, 6, 4, 4, 5, 6, 8, 7 };

===>Sample Output
1 2 4 5 6 7 8
