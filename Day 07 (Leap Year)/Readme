This program is written in Java and is used to determine if a year entered by the user is a leap year or not. It uses the Scanner class to take input from the user, which is an integer representing a year. The program then uses the modulus operator to check if the year is evenly divisible by 4. If it is, the program checks if the year is evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400, if the year is evenly divisible by 100 and 400, it will be a leap year. If it is not evenly divisible by 4 or if it is evenly divisible by 100 but not by 400, it will not be a leap year. The program then prints out whether the year is a leap year or not.
