This program is written in Java and is used to reverse a number that is entered by the user. It uses the Scanner class to take input from the user and assigns it to the variable "n". The program then uses a while loop to update the reverse value of the input number in the variable "rev". The while loop continues until the value of "n" is greater than 0. Inside the loop, the last digit of the input number is determined by using the modulus operator and it is added to the variable "rev" after being multiplied by 10. The input number is then divided by 10 in order to remove the last digit and prepare for the next iteration of the loop. Once the loop is finished, the final reversed value is printed out to the user.
