What is a Regular Expression?
A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.

Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

Java does not have a built-in Regular Expression class, but we can import the java.util.regex package to work with regular expressions. The package includes the following classes:

Pattern Class - Defines a pattern (to be used in a search)
Matcher Class - Used to search for the pattern
PatternSyntaxException Class - Indicates syntax error in a regular expression pattern

Write a class called MyRegex which will contain a string pattern. You need to write a regular expression and assign it to the pattern such that it can be used to validate an IP address. Use the following definition of an IP address:

IP address is a string in the form "A.B.C.D", where the value of A, B, C, and D may range from 0 to 255. Leading zeros are allowed. The length of A, B, C, or D can't be greater than 3.
Some valid IP address:

000.12.12.034
121.234.12.12
23.45.12.56
Some invalid IP address:

000.12.234.23.23
666.666.23.23
.213.123.23.32
23.45.22.32.
I.Am.not.an.ip
In this problem you will be provided strings containing any combination of ASCII characters. You have to write a regular expression to find the valid IPs.

Just write the MyRegex class which contains a String . The string should contain the correct regular expression.

(MyRegex class MUST NOT be public)

Sample Input

000.12.12.034
